**Here's a GitHub README for your Java Adaptive Quiz Game using SMILE Machine Learning:**

Adaptive Quiz Game (Java + SMILE)
A Java-based quiz game that dynamically adjusts difficulty using machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbors - KNN) from the SMILE library. The game features a Swing-based UI and adapts questions based on user performance, but also has an command line runner interface.

**Features:<BR>**
✅ Adaptive Difficulty using KNN Machine Learning<BR>
✅ Randomized Questions from a predefined question bank<BR>
✅ Swing-based UI for an interactive experience<BR>
✅ Tracks User Performance and adjusts difficulty dynamicall<BR>

**Installation & Setup:**

1. Clone the Repository
- git [clone https://github.com/your-username/adaptive-quiz-game.git](https://github.com/costinbadea-93/adaptive-quiz-game-JAVA-SMILE-.git)
- cd adaptive-quiz-game-JAVA-SMILE-

2. Compile & Run
mvn clean install
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="QuizGame"



**Usage<br>**
- Start the game and answer quiz questions.
- Machine Learning (KNN) adjusts difficulty based on your responses.
- Score is tracked, and difficulty adapts dynamically.


**Example code<br>**
Adaptive Difficulty (KNN)
import smile.classification.KNN;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class KNNAdaptiveDifficulty {
    private KNN<int[]> knnModel;
    private List<int[]> trainingData;
    private List<Integer> labels;

    public KNNAdaptiveDifficulty() {
        trainingData = new ArrayList<>();
        labels = new ArrayList<>();
        trainModel();
    }

    private void trainModel() {
        trainingData.add(new int[]{0, 1});
        trainingData.add(new int[]{2, 2});
        trainingData.add(new int[]{5, 3});
        trainingData.add(new int[]{7, 4});
        trainingData.add(new int[]{10, 5});

        labels.add(1);
        labels.add(2);
        labels.add(3);
        labels.add(4);
        labels.add(5);

        knnModel = KNN.fit(trainingData.toArray(new int[0][0]), labels.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray(), 3);
    }

    public int predictDifficulty(int score) {
        int[] input = {score, 2}; // Assume medium difficulty initially
        return knnModel.predict(input);
    }

**Training model<br>**

How It Works
- Feature Matrix (double[][] features)
- Each row represents a question.
- Column 1: Simulated user score (currently just the question index i).
- Column 2: Question difficulty from questions.get(i).getDifficulty().
- Labels (int[] labels)
- Stores the difficulty level for each question.
- Training the KNN Model (KNN.fit())
- Takes features as input data and labels as the output (difficulty level).
- Uses k=1, meaning the closest neighbor determines the difficulty.
  Potential Improvements
  ✅ Use real user scores: Instead of i, track actual correct/incorrect responses.
  ✅ More Features: Include response time, accuracy history for better difficulty prediction.
  ✅ Tune K Value: k=1 is simple but may cause abrupt difficulty shifts. Try k=3 for more stability.

**Prediction<br>**

How It Works
- Creates an input feature array
- {score, 2} → Uses the user's score and a fixed difficulty value of 2.
- The score represents how well the user is performing.
- The second element (question difficulty) is currently hardcoded as 2, which could be improved.
- Predicts difficulty using KNN
- knnModel.predict(input) calls the trained KNN model to classify the difficulty level.
- Returns an integer representing the predicted difficulty (1, 2, or 3).
  Potential Improvements
  ✅ Replace the fixed 2 value → Instead of hardcoding difficulty, use the difficulty of the last question.


KNN.fit() is a method from the Smile machine learning library that trains a k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. It works by learning from labeled data so that it can predict classifications for new, unseen data. Here's a breakdown:
How KNN.fit() Works
- Takes Input Features (double[][] features)
- Each row represents a data point.
- Columns hold values like score, difficulty, response time, etc.
- Takes Labels (int[] labels)
- Stores the actual class (difficulty level).
- KNN learns patterns from this labeled dataset.
- Creates a KNN Model (KNN.fit(features, labels, k))
- It finds the k nearest neighbors for a given input.
- Uses distance calculations (e.g., Euclidean distance) to determine similarity.
- The most frequent label among the neighbors decides the predicted class.

  Example
  If your dataset has:
  double[][] features = { {10, 1}, {20, 2}, {30, 3}, {40, 3} };
  int[] labels = {1, 2, 3, 3};  // Corresponding difficulty levels
  KNN<double[]> knn = KNN.fit(features, labels, 3);  // Train model with k=3


- When predicting {25, 2}, KNN finds 3 closest points and selects the majority label.
  Key Concepts
  ✅ Distance Calculation → Measures similarity between points.
  ✅ Choosing K Value → Affects classification accuracy.
  ✅ Larger Dataset → Improves prediction reliability.

How knnModel.predict(input) Works

- Takes Input (double[] input)
- input is a feature array {score, question difficulty}.
- The model finds similar past entries from the training dataset.
- Finds K Nearest Neighbors
- It computes distances between input and all stored data points.
- If k=3, it selects the 3 closest past responses.
- Majority Vote for Prediction
- Among the closest k neighbors, the most common difficulty level is chosen.
- If the closest entries were labeled as difficulty 2, predict(input) will likely return 2.
  Example Walkthrough
  Imagine your dataset looks like this:
  double[][] features = { {15, 1}, {30, 2}, {40, 3}, {35, 3} };
  int[] labels = {1, 2, 3, 3};  // Corresponding difficulty levels
  KNN<double[]> knnModel = KNN.fit(features, labels, 3);  // k=3


Now, when calling:
int predictedDifficulty = knnModel.predict(new double[]{32, 2});


- KNN finds the 3 closest neighbors ({30, 2}, {35, 3}, {40, 3}).
- The majority class (3) wins, so predict() returns 3.
