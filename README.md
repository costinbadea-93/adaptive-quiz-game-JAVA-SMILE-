Here's a GitHub README for your Java Adaptive Quiz Game using SMILE Machine Learning:

Adaptive Quiz Game (Java + SMILE)
A Java-based quiz game that dynamically adjusts difficulty using machine learning (K-Nearest Neighbors - KNN) from the SMILE library. The game features a Swing-based UI and adapts questions based on user performance, but also has an command line runner interface.

Features<BR>
✅ Adaptive Difficulty using KNN Machine Learning<BR>
✅ Randomized Questions from a predefined question bank<BR>
✅ Swing-based UI for an interactive experience<BR>
✅ Tracks User Performance and adjusts difficulty dynamicall<BR>


Installation & Setup:

1. Clone the Repository
- git clone https://github.com/your-username/adaptive-quiz-game.git
- cd adaptive-quiz-game


Usage
- Start the game and answer quiz questions.
- Machine Learning (KNN) adjusts difficulty based on your responses.
- Score is tracked, and difficulty adapts dynamically.


Example Code
Adaptive Difficulty (KNN)
import smile.classification.KNN;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class KNNAdaptiveDifficulty {
    private KNN<int[]> knnModel;
    private List<int[]> trainingData;
    private List<Integer> labels;

    public KNNAdaptiveDifficulty() {
        trainingData = new ArrayList<>();
        labels = new ArrayList<>();
        trainModel();
    }

    private void trainModel() {
        trainingData.add(new int[]{0, 1});
        trainingData.add(new int[]{2, 2});
        trainingData.add(new int[]{5, 3});
        trainingData.add(new int[]{7, 4});
        trainingData.add(new int[]{10, 5});

        labels.add(1);
        labels.add(2);
        labels.add(3);
        labels.add(4);
        labels.add(5);

        knnModel = KNN.fit(trainingData.toArray(new int[0][0]), labels.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray(), 3);
    }

    public int predictDifficulty(int score) {
        int[] input = {score, 2}; // Assume medium difficulty initially
        return knnModel.predict(input);
    }
}
